# Ritmo

p <strong>RITMO</strong> is a fork from Compass vertical-rhythm. It rules the vertical rhythm of the site based on the initial font size, managing the vertical margins, paddings and line-height.<br><br> It keeps your site organized and structured on a coherent baseline grid. It uses <strong>rem</strong> unit by default but it can also use <strong>em</strong> or <strong>px</strong> values for measurement.

p The only dependency is SASS. We also provide an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ritmo">npm</a> package.
