![Ritmo - A vertical rhythm sass toolkit](http://ritmo.marzeelabs.org/images/logo-small.jpg "Ritmo")

**RITMO** is a fork from Compass vertical-rhythm. It rules the vertical rhythm of the site based on the initial font size, managing the vertical margins, paddings and line-height.<br><br> It keeps your site organized and structured on a coherent baseline grid. It uses **rem** unit by default but it can also use **em** or **px** values for measurement.

The only dependency is SASS. We also provide an <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/ritmo">npm</a> package.
